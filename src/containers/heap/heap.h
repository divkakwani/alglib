/*
 *  Abstract class for a heap
 *  Any heap must conform to this interface
 *
 *  There are two types of ordering of the type elt_t - natural ordering and
 *  priority ordering. The operator< defines the natural ordering and the
 *  keys associated with the elements define the priority ordering. The former
 *  ordering is defined by the class and the latter by the client of this
 *  library.
 *  The natural ordering is used to establish the equality of two elements. If
 *  none of the two elements is greater than the other, then they are equal.
 *  Hence, the `min_heap` class is configurable with different schemes of
 *  priority ordering by supplying corresponding keys. In case, none is
 *  supplied, the ordering chosen by the `min_heap` defaults to natural
 *  ordering.
 *
 * 	The reason of having another variable `key` for ordering the
 * 	elements is to decouple the scheme of ordering from the
 * 	object itself.
 * 	If we use operator< of elt's class, it would be far too
 * 	restrictive. It would allow only one type of ordering - the
 * 	one defined by the class. In many situations, that may not be
 * 	the scheme we require. Worse still, it precludes any non-comparable
 * 	item from being used to make a min-heap.
 *	To make this more concrete, consider a use-case in which a shopkeeper
 *	services the requests of his customers. The customers are of Person type
 *	that doesn't have any total-ordering relation. The shopkeeper, however,
 *	can have different schemes of prioritizing his customers, some of them
 *	are -
 *		Prioritize the shop's investor.
 *		Prioritize senior citizens.
 *		Prioritize acquaintances
 *		... and so on.
 *	The essence of this methodology is that the criterion of ordering should
 *	be specified by the min_heap user, not by the class.
 *
 *  Why not use a functor?
 *  Using a functor can potentially lead to inconsistency of the heap. Since by
 *  allowing the user to supply a user-defined functor, we allow him to change
 *  the priority order arbitrarily and as many times as the user wishes, but
 *  the heap requires that every change be followed by a sift up or a sift down.
 *
