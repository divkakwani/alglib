# Algorithms Library ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/divkakwani/alglib.svg?branch=master)


A library of generic algorithms intended as an extension of the STL. All the algorithms are compatible with STL containers and follow similar design patterns as that of the STL.

**Note** : The library uses new features of C++11/14 and hence is not backward-compatible.

### Dependencies
* Some of the boost libraries. For now, the following libraries are used:
    * Boost.Optional
    * Boost.Iterator
    * BCCL
* Catch testing framework. It comes bundled with the source. So, there is no requirement to install it.

### Install
* Download the source code and add the path of src to the `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` environment variable.

### Documentation
The documentation is available online [here](https://divkakwani.github.io/alglib)

### First Release
The first release is expected near the end of this year. The current goals include the development
of:
* Graph Library
* Tree Library
* Automata Library
