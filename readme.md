# Algorithms Library ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/divkakwani/alglib.svg?branch=master)


A library of generic algorithms intended as an extension of the STL. All the algorithms are compatible with STL containers and follow similar design patterns as that of the STL.

**Note** : The library uses new features of C++11/14 and hence is not backward-compatible.

### Install
* Download the source code and add the path of src to the `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` environment variable.

### Documentation
